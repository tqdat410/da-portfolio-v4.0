- Projects (10 portfolio items with metadata)
- Contact information (email, phone, 11 social platforms)

### Design System (Silver Mist)

**Color Palette**
```
Background:  #f1f5f9 (Slate 100)
Primary:     #0f172a (Slate 900)
Body:        #1e293b (Slate 800)
Secondary:   #64748b (Slate 500)
Surface:     rgba(241, 245, 249, 0.7)
Highlight:   #ffffff
```

**Typography**
- Headings: Luxurious Roman (serif, 400 weight)
- Display: Style Script (cursive)
- Mono: Geist Mono (for code)

## Component Hierarchy

## Data Flow

```
Content Source: portfolio.ts (TypeScript)
  ↓
Components consume via imports
  ↓
GSAP monitors scroll position
  ↓
Animations trigger on intersection
  ↓
WebGL renders effects
```

## Constraints & Dependencies

### Technical Constraints
- WebGL 2.0 required for texture formats
- GPU VRAM: 256MB minimum for shader textures
- JavaScript ES2020 target minimum

### External Dependencies
- **Google Fonts**: Luxurious Roman, Style Script (CDN)
