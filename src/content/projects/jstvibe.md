## Overview

JSTVibe is a spontaneous, fast-built product created in a few days with an AI-first workflow (Antigravity). The project is a curated directory for Vibe Coding products, combining a global map view, searchable listing, and sponsored spotlight placement. A key technical goal was practicing real international payment integration through **pola.sh**.

## Key Features

- Global product discovery map with country-based stats and selection
- Search, filter, and pagination for approved products
- Spotlight/sponsored marquee section for promoted products
- International payment integration using pola.sh for monetization flow
- Fast AI-assisted delivery loop using Antigravity
